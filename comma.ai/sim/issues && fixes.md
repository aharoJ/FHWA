> Hi, thank you for the reply. Yes, I've tried that and my modeld is not crashing anymore (even though it do actually crash sometimes, depends on my luck but better than before). However, then my simulator shows "Vehicle Parameter Identification Failed" and I solve it using this #27282 Hope it helps anyone who is facing the same issue.
